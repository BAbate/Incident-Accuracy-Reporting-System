# 1. Overview
## Embrace Theme
### Police & Judicial Reform and Accountability:
From traffic stops and arrests to sentencing and parole decisions, use technology to better analyze real-world data, provide insights, and make recommendations that will drive racial equality and reform across criminal justice and public safety.

### Problem Statement:
The lack of transparent and accurate data available to assess police behavioral infractions means, police reports can be falsified and contain other inaccuracies.

This solution addresses the hill outlined below related to the problem statement above:

### Hill:
Internal affairs and civilians (such as witnesses) can both contribute to incident reports, creating a tamper-proof record with all accounts of the incident.

# 2. The Idea

A Content Management application for capturing statements from first-hand individuals relating to police incident reports.
* Interface for first-hand individuals to input information or data related to incident report
* Automated/Manual flagging of errors and inaccuracies contained in initial incident reports based on collected data
* Cross reference report data with officer history on misconduct
* Mechanism for disputing claims in incident reports

# 3. How It Works

## Solution:


### Consideration

* If a 911 call is made, the eventâ€™s address, date, and time is logged as an incident.

* An incident may or may not be given a case number
* Incidents reported via app can be linked by provided case number (if known), or by correlating the submitted metadata(location, date, and time)  with a logged incident from the police department
* If an event has not yet been logged as an incident by the police department (ex: occurring live at a protest), reported incidents submitted through app can be tagged as pending until a matching police incident can be linked once filed.  


### Included Technology Components

* Web Application: built using the Vue.js frontend framework. This can be run locally or on IBM Cloud. The web application provides the dashboard and is at the core of the solution.
* [Watson Speech To Text](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text):  This is a IBM Cloud service that converts human voice into written text. This application uses it to create written transcripts from audio recordings loaded by witnesses and victims.
* [Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant):  (lite Tier) is a distributed, document-oriented NoSQL database that is running on the IBM Cloud.
* [Blockchain](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/): Based on the open-soure enterprise grade permissioned disributed ledger; Hyperledger Fabric. The blockchain network is an immutable transaction ledger. This was used to ensure that the submitted reports and information from victims and witnesses are tamper-proof. Each stored document has a hash tag that is stored in the Blockchain. You can run the application without it.
* [IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage): (lite tier) stores encrypted and dispersed data. Documents(incident reports, videos, audios) are  IBM Cloud Object Storage.
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): an open source, cross-platform solution to record, converrt and stream audio and videos. This was used to transcribe the audio portion of a video.
* Machine Learning - K-Means Clustering

# 4. Design

## Persona/ User
Engaging personas emphasise how stories can engage and bring the personas to life.

## User journey: AS-IS Experience
As-is Scenario Maps help us to document collective understanding of user workflows and are best used as precursors to exploring new ideas or for finding the right problem to solve. The AS-IS map was developed based on information gathered via user research and validated with users.

## User journey: TO-BE Experience
Similarly to the AS IS journey,this journey reflects the future predicted proesses. Since this takes place in the future, we  tailor these phases based on what we'd like the user journey to look like, imagining the impact of our solution in their journey. We also did user research to reflect this journeys based on our solution.

## Prototyping - Wireframes
We used prototype digital user interfaces at low and mid-fidelity to quickly get feedback. We tested this wireframes with our users and iterated this wireframes to better suit them. This in an example of the Police officer Dashboard at low-fidelity.

This is an example of the App at mid-fidelity.

# 7. Getting started

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) - Container-based software that standardizes a unit of software and enables developers to isolate their app from the environmen
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - a JavaScript Framework
- [NPM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
- Register for an [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42793&eventid=cfc-2020?cm_mmc=OSocial_Blog-_-Audience+Developer_Developer+Conversation-_-WW_WW-_-cfc-2020-ghub-starterkit-cooperation_ov75914&cm_mmca1=000039JL&cm_mmca2=10008917) account.
- Install and configure [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#overview).



## Steps


1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)

2. [Provision Cloud Services](#2-provision-cloud-services)

3. [Provision Blockchain Ledger](#3-provision-blockchain-ledger)

4. [Start web application](#4-start-web-application)


### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/lions-of-justice) locally. In a terminal, run:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/lions-of-justice
```

### 2. Provision Cloud Services

Create a Speech to Text service [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text). Once the service is created, place your credentials in the `backend/STT-Audio/.env` file like so.

```
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_IAM_APIKEY=<>
SPEECH_TO_TEXT_URL=<>
```

Create an Object Storage service [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloud-object-storage)

### 3. Provision Blockchain Ledger

After setting up the Object Storage and Speech to Text services, we'll need to then deploy a blockchain ledger. This ledger will keep track of all digital assets

*Local Deployment*
```
cd backend/blockchain/local
./startFabric.sh
```

*Cloud Deployment*

If you will be hosting this application in the cloud, you'll also need to deploy a blockchain ledger in the cloud. To do so, provision an [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster). This may take up to 20 minutes to provision.

Once the Kubernetes cluster has been provisioned, next create a [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain-platform) service.

Then, configure the IBM Blockchain Platform as documented [here](https://github.com/kkbankol-ibm/Blockchain-for-maintaining-Digital-Assets?organization=kkbankol-ibm&organization=kkbankol-ibm#5-build-a-network)


### 4. Start web application


*Local Deployment*

Ensure you are in the *./lions-for-justice* directory

```
cd lions-for-justice
```

Start frontend web app
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run serve
```

Start backend
```
cd backend
npm start
```


# 8. IARS Recommendations for Enhancements of Capabilities

**Incident Accuracy Reporting System (IARS)**

### Ideas for Extending IARS Functionality
* Internal Affair access to unofficial Complaints investigation matched with available evidence in App
* Transparency of Police Chief action throughout a police misconduct investigation and recommendation outcome
* Collaboration of isolated systems with Internal Affairs investigationÂ  evidence & recommendations
* Provide victim/witness of Police misconduct investigation outcomes and enable capability for victim to obtain reports


### Ideas for Extending IARS Technically

- Support for multi-cloud, multi-networks: deploying the application across any cloud platform or a multi-cloud platform. This is especially important if the system may want to be run across state lines and different Cloud platforms are used.  Also if different blockchain networks are used - it makes it easier to interconnect "mixed networks". Consider deploying on top of RH OpenShift.
- Add a ML filter to ensure accuracy of posted evidence from the public
- Adding mobile support
- Adding container security software: lifecycle vulnerability management for scanning containers (on RHM: Neuvector)
