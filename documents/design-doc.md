## User journey: AS-IS Experience
As-is Scenario Maps help us to document collective understanding of user workflows and are best used as precursors to exploring new ideas or for finding the right problem to solve. The AS-IS map was developed based on information gathered via user research and validated with users.

## User journey: TO-BE Experience
Similarly to the AS IS journey,this journey reflects the future predicted proesses. Since this takes place in the future, we  tailor these phases based on what we'd like the user journey to look like, imagining the impact of our solution in their journey. We also did user research to reflect this journeys based on our solution.
